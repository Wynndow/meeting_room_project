Hello,

Your meeting room booking details for {{day}} are:

{% for event in events %}
  Title: {{event.summary}}
  Room: {{ event.location }}
  Start: {{ event.start }}
  End: {{ event.end }}

{% endfor %}

Delete your room booking if you don't need it
---------------------------------------------

If you don't need the room booking anymore, please delete it so someone else can use the room.

You can delete a room booking in a series without affecting your future bookings.

Think about using a smaller room
--------------------------------

If you've got fewer people coming to the meeting than you first thought, it would be great if you could try moving to a smaller room.
